## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - For new features
- `bugfix/description` - For bug fixes
- `docs/description` - For documentation changes
- `refactor/description` - For code refactoring

### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes following our coding standards**

3. **Run tests and linting:**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   pytest
   
   # Format code
   black src/ tests/
   
   # Sort imports
   isort src/ tests/
   
   # Lint code
   flake8 src/
   
   # Type checking
   mypy src/
   ```

4. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

5. **Push and create a pull request**

### Commit Message Format

We use conventional commits:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Example: `feat: add support for sleep stage analysis`

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_whoop_client.py

# Run tests with specific marker
pytest -m unit
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external API calls
- Test both success and failure scenarios

Example test structure:
```python
def test_feature_description():
    """Test that feature works correctly under normal conditions"""
    # Arrange
    setup_test_data()
    
    # Act
    result = function_under_test()
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_value
```

## üìù Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Use clear, descriptive function and variable names
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Include type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Comment complex logic and algorithms

### Documentation Files

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update docs/ for detailed documentation changes
- Add examples for new features
- Update troubleshooting guides for known issues

## üîê Security Considerations

### Security Guidelines

- Never commit real tokens, API keys, or personal data
- Use mock data in tests
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all user inputs
- Handle errors gracefully without exposing sensitive information

### Reporting Security Issues

Please report security vulnerabilities privately to evstigneevromanv@gmail.com rather than opening public issues.
